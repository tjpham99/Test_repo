# Problem: Cut-Out Art

In this exercise, you'll practice writing CSS rules and using different selectors to style specific elements.

To complete the exercise, add rules to the included `css/style.css` file that apply the styling notes listed in the included `index.html` file. (That is: open up the HTML file and look at the comments for what style each element should have. Then write a rule that applies that style to that element). For this exercise, you must **not** modify the HTML file: try to come up with selectors based only on the provided structure!
